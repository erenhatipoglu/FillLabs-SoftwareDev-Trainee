# Recursive Sequence Generator

## Description
This Go program defines a recursive function, `generateSequence`, which generates a sequence of integers based on the input value.

The output is derived from a recursive logic applied to the input. The specific algorithm deduces intermediate values based on decrementing steps.

## Input Example
Input: 9  
Output: 2, 4, 9  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Go is installed.
2. Run the program:

go run question2.go


## Testing
Unit tests can be executed with:

go test -v
